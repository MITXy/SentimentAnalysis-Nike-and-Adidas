If your  lady with acrylic nails they would all be off by the time you got these shoes on!

I don’t mean I picked up a skateboard when I got old - I’ve actually been skating since I was 7 or 8 years old thanks to my first grade teacher, Mrs. Anderson, having shown our classroom the movie about the Signal Hill downhill race from 1976 or 1977, when the movie was new. I have no earthly idea how an elementary school teacher got hold of a brand new film to show our class, but I digress. The point is I’ve been skating for about 45 years and have a host of injuries for which I’ve been treated and I needed some good, stabile shoes that don’t look silly (not that there’s anything wrong with that, but at my age…). \\n\\nI like most of Adidas’ skateboarding line (especially the Busenitz) however the Sambas have always held a special place in my mind - they’re classic and were made for running on the flat, level pitch, and lately, I’ve needed to avoid loads of young kids on scooters - running out has become more frequent than landing anything. As in the 80s, shoes designed for lateral stability (side to side) while running (e.g., Sambas / back and forth) make great skate shoes - I can feel my board but don’t feel pain after I run out. Since they’re so classic-looking, at least I look good running out. ;-)</div>',\n",

I don’t mean I picked up a skateboard when I got old - I’ve actually been skating since I was 7 or 8 years old thanks to my first grade teacher, Mrs. Anderson, having shown our classroom the movie about the Signal Hill downhill race from 1976 or 1977, when the movie was new. I have no earthly idea how an elementary school teacher got hold of a brand new film to show our class, but I digress. The point is I’ve been skating for about 45 years and have a host of injuries for which I’ve been treated and I needed some good, stabile shoes that don’t look silly (not that there’s anything wrong with that, but at my age…). \\n\\nI like most of Adidas’ skateboarding line (especially the Busenitz) however the Sambas have always held a special place in my mind - they’re classic and were made for running on the flat, level pitch, and lately, I’ve needed to avoid loads of young kids on scooters - running out has become more frequent than landing anything. As in the 80s, shoes designed for lateral stability (side to side) while running (e.g., Sambas / back and forth) make great skate shoes - I can feel my board but don’t feel pain after I run out. Since they’re so classic-looking, at least I look good running out. ;-)',\n",
